FIGURE THESE OUT BEFORE YOU BEGIN:

TECH SPECS:
- What displays do you have to support?
- What browsers?
- What languages are you going to use?
- What third party libraries/technologies do you require?
	- What are the third party requirements of you?


USER STORIES VOCAB:
- Agile teams
	- Sprints that last 1-4 wks
- Come up with hypothetical stories from users who would use your app/site
	- Why are they using it?
	- What are things about them?
When writing their stories come up with these:
Who? is writing them?
What? are they doing with it?
Why? are they using the service?
Ex.
"As a climber I want to select a route based on difficulty to match so I don't
