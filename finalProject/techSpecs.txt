    explanation: "The explosion is over but the consequences continue. About eleven
    thousand years ago a star in the constellation of Vela could be seen to explode,
    creating a strange point of light briefly visible to humans living near the 
    beginning of recorded history. The outer layers of the star crashed into the 
    interstellar medium, driving a shock wave that is still visible today. A roughly 
    spherical, expanding shock wave is visible in X-rays. The above image captures some
    of that filamentary and gigantic shock in visible light. As gas flies away from the
    detonated star, it decays and reacts with the interstellar medium, producing light
    in many different colors and energy bands. Remaining at the center of the Vela
    Supernova Remnant is a pulsar, a star as dense as nuclear matter that rotates
    completely around more than ten times in a single second.",

User Stories:

1. As a student I would like to learn something new every time
I interact with this website so that I don't have to spend as 
much time searching for new information or things to learn about.

2. As a hobbyist I want to be able to find the source of the
data that I'm being showed so that I can look directly into
them to further research astronomy.

3. As a developer I would like to see all of the information
that can be accessed so that I can provide more features
to the users
